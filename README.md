This project analyses customer purchase data collected during Black Friday sales to identify
key demographic and behavioural patterns that influence purchasing behaviour and predict
future purchase amounts using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains
information about customer demographics, such as gender, age, occupation, city category,
and stay duration, as well as detailed purchase histories.
Our approach begins with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand
the distribution of purchase amounts and correlations among features. This analysis is
followed by rigorous data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding
categorical features, and feature selection. We then apply several supervised learning
models, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree, and
Random Forest, to evaluate predictive accuracy and select the optimal model for purchase
prediction. Model performance is assessed using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared scores, revealing Random Forest as the
most effective model with the highest predictive accuracy and minimal error rates.
Additionally, we employ unsupervised clustering techniques, including MiniBatch K-Means
and Hierarchical Clustering, to segment customers based on their purchase behaviour and
demographics, unveiling distinct customer groups that can be targeted with tailored
marketing strategies. These insights contribute to a data-driven approach for retail
businesses, supporting personalized marketing, inventory planning, and customer
engagement initiatives.
This project underscores the potential of machine learning in retail analytics, demonstrating
how predictive models and clustering can enhance understanding of customer behaviour.
Future work could explore advanced ensemble models, hyperparameter tuning, and
additional features to improve predictive accuracy and better support decision-making
processes in a retail context.
